# OrbitCoach ReAct Agent ‚Äì C4 Assignment

## üìò Overview
This project implements a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** agent for **OrbitCoach Tutors**,  
a personalized tutoring platform that blends human expertise with AI.  
The agent is built using **LangGraph**, integrating multiple tools and distinct personas  
to simulate reasoning, tool usage, and adaptive tone.

The system automatically loads company data from:
- `about_business.pdf` ‚Äì detailed company profile  
- `summary.txt` ‚Äì executive summary  

This ensures answers are grounded in real OrbitCoach information.

| **Framework** | Built with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) for explicit ReAct control. |
| **ReAct Logic** | Manual reasoning‚Äìaction‚Äìobservation loop implemented with states and conditional edges. |
| **Personas** | Two modes: `friendly` (warm, motivational) and `strict` (concise, precise). |
| **Tools** | `kb_search`, `price_estimate`, and `schedule_lookup` for retrieval, pricing, and scheduling. |
| **Document Grounding** | The `kb_search` tool retrieves snippets from company documents (PDF/TXT). |
| **Experiments** | CLI harness for temperature, persona, and prompt-style testing. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Reasoning Step:** The model ‚Äúthinks‚Äù about what it needs to answer.  
2. **Action Step:** If a tool is required, it emits  
3. **Observation Step:** The tool executes, returns results, and feeds them back to the model.  
4. **Answer Step:** The model finalizes its grounded answer.

This flow repeats until the agent marks itself `done = True`.
